Parker-Surprised:
Look who it is!

Erik-Neutral:
Aren! Good to see you! Glad you could make it.

Aren-Neutral:
Sorry I’m late.

Blaire-Neutral:
Hey, at least you beat Rory. I swear, that woman can’t show up on time to save her own life.

Philippe-Neutral:
I told you to give Rory an earlier time to avoid this.

Blaire-Neutral:
Yeah, yeah, whatever, Philippe. I’m gonna get some drinks. Want anything, Aren?

Aren-Neutral:
I’m good, thanks.

Geoffrey-Neutral:
I’ll take a pint!

Blaire-Thinking:
Haven’t you had two already?

Geoffrey-Angry:
What are you, my mum? I thought we were here to hang out and cut loose!

Blaire-Neutral:
It’s your funeral. Don’t come crying to me if you’re hungover tomorrow.

Geoffrey-Neutral:
Yes, mum!

Blaire-Neutral:
Parker, Philippe, Erik, anything for you three?

Erik-Neutral:
I’ll take a pint as well!

Parker-Neutral:
Nothing for me.

Philippe-Neutral:
A glass of brandy, please.

Blaire-Thinking:
On the rocks?

Philippe-Neutral:
Are you a heathen? Brandy must always be drunk neat.

Blaire-Neutral:
Alright. Sorry I’m not a pretentious git like yourself.

Geoffrey-Neutral:
*snigger*

Philippe-Neutral:
Is name calling really necessary?

Blaire-Neutral:
Always. \nBe back in a bit.

Erik-Neutral:
It feels like forever since we last hung out together, just the seven of us. 

Parker-Neutral:
Yeah. I’m glad we could all make it today, I missed you guys!

Philippe-Neutral:
I mean, we’re all adults now. We all have our own pack responsibilities to handle. It’s understandable that we’re not able to hang out as frequently. Different schedules and all that.

Geoffrey-Angry:
Ugh! I hate being a responsible pack member! Can we go back to being kids, and just run wild and free?

Parker-Neutral:
Cheers to that, mate!

Erik-Neutral:
Agreed!

Aren-Thinking:
I do miss the good old days sometimes. We were a bunch of little terrors back then.

Parker-Neutral:
Hell yeah, we were! Just think of all the grey hairs we’ve given Warrick over the years! I bet Isabella’s wanted to strangle the lot of us on more than one occasion.

Philippe-Neutral:
Speak for yourselves, Rory and I were perfectly behaved children. We never got in trouble with our leaders.

Parker-Neutral:
That’s because everyone loves Rory, and is willing to forgive her for almost anything. You’re an entirely different story, mate.

Philippe-Neutral:
Pardon? I am a delightful person to--

Erik-Surprised:
Oh look, it’s Rory! Perfect timing!

Rory-Neutral:
Sorry I’m late, everyone!

Erik-Neutral:
It’s fine, Aren got here not too long ago herself.

Rory-Neutral:
That’s a relief, at least.

Aren-Neutral:
How’ve you been, Rory?

Rory-Sad:
Busy. Isabella’s been running me ragged these past few weeks.

Parker-Neutral:
Not too busy to hang out with us, though?

Rory-Neutral:
Never! I already miss you all too much as it is.

Blaire-Neutral:
I come bearing drinks!

Geoffrey-Neutral:
Thank the gods!

Philippe-Neutral:
Thank you, Blaire.

Blaire-Neutral:
You’re welcome, snob.

Philippe-Neutral:
Hey!

Rory-Neutral:
*giggle*

Blaire-Surprised:
Rory! You’re here! 

Blaire-Neutral:
Glad you could make it!

Rory-Neutral:
Me too!

Parker-Neutral:
So what made you late this time, Rory?

Rory-Sad:
Oh! Uh, I might have misplaced my office keys.

Blaire-Sad:
Oh Rory. Again?

Rory-Sad:
I know, I know! Isabella’s going to kill me if she finds out that I lost them for the third time. It’s getting ridiculous.

Blaire-Neutral:
Why don’t we help you look for them, then?

Erik-Neutral:
Yeah! It wouldn’t be the first time we’ve helped you recover a lost item. 

Aren-Neutral:
I’m down to help!

Rory-Neutral:
Guys, thank you, but it’s really not necessary. I’ll look for them tomorrow before I go to work. 

Aren-Neutral:
Come on, Rory! It’ll be just like old times.

Parker-Neutral:
Maybe it’ll turn into an adventure!

Geoffrey-Neutral:
Like that time when we searched like half the forest for your missing teddy bear when we were pups! We didn’t get back home until way after dark. 
Man, Isabella and Warrick were so pissed at us for that!

Rory-Sad:
Guys…

Philippe-Neutral:
Let’s at least finish our drinks before we head out on this quest.

Blaire-Neutral:
*chug* \n*chug* \n*chug*
Done!

Philippe-Neutral:
How utterly barbaric.

Aren-Surprised:
He means “That was impressive, Blaire!” \nDon’t you, Philippe?

Philippe-Neutral:
Definitely not. I meant what I said, Aren.

Aren-Neutral:
Would it kill you to be just a bit more polite?

Parker-Neutral:
It probably would.

Blaire-Neutral:
Definitely would.

Geoffrey-Neutral:
The fact that it hasn’t already is astounding.

Rory-Neutral:
Guys, you really don’t have to. I can do this on my own.

Parker-Neutral:
Nonsense! It’ll be fun!

Blaire-Neutral:
Besides, it’s not like we haven’t helped you out like this before.

Erik-Thinking:
That’s what friends are for, right?

Rory-Neutral:
*sigh* \nThanks.

Erik-Neutral:
Then let’s head out! Onwards to our noble quest!

Geoffrey-Angry:
Wait, I haven’t finished my pint yet! \nGuys! \nWait for me!
