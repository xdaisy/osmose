Rory-Neutral:
Thank you guys so much!

Geoffrey-Neutral:
Yeah, sure, whatever.

Blaire-Neutral:
Knock it off, Geoffrey. We all know you’re actually just a softy.

Geoffrey-Angry:
S-shut up, Blaire!

Rory-Neutral:
*giggle*

Parker-Neutral:
It was no problem, Rory. Besides, Aren did most of the work  anyway. I think she deserves most of the credit.

Rory-Neutral:
That’s true! Thanks, Aren! You’re really good at this kind of thing. I bet you never lose anything.

Aren-Neutral:
It’s no big deal.

Philippe-Neutral:
She’s modest, too.

Blaire-Neutral:
Isn’t she always?

Aren-Neutral:
Heh heh.

Rory-Surprised<j>:
Oh shoot! \nI still haven’t delivered that paperwork for Mrs. McCarthy! I gotta run!

Erik-Surprised:
Wait! \nWe’re supposed to go over my lesson plans together tonight!

Rory-Surprised:
Right! \nDarn it! \nI’ll meet you back at the pub in thirty minutes! Promise!

Parker-Neutral:
And she’s gone.

Erik-Neutral:
*sigh* \nGuess I’m heading back to the pub.

Philippe-Neutral:
Hopefully she’ll only be thirty minutes late.

Erik-Neutral:
*SIGH* \nHopefully they still have coffee at this hour.

Geoffrey-Neutral:
Ha! Sucks to be you, mate!

Aren-Neutral:
Hopefully she remembers our plans for tomorrow. I forgot to remind her.

Parker-Neutral:
Oh, she always remembers plans, just not times.

Aren-Sad:
*Sigh* \nMaybe I should join you for a drink, Erik. Something stronger than coffee may be required.

Blaire-Neutral:
Ha ha ha! 

Erik-Neutral:
Any other night I’d be willing to drink and commiserate with you, Aren, but I have a monsterous stack of lesson plans to go through, and I should probably get a head start on them.
Another time?

Aren-Neutral:
Another time, then!

Blaire-Neutral:
Well, have a good night everyone. Hopefully we can all hang out again soon!

Parker-Neutral:
Definitely! This was fun!

Geoffrey-Neutral:
As long as there’s alcohol, I’ll be there!

Aidan-Neutral:
Good night!

Philippe-Neutral:
I look forward to it.

Erik-Neutral:
For sure! See you all later!

Aren-Neutral:
Night everyone!
