Portraitless:
Some time later, at the bar

Blaire-Neutral:
To Rory and Erik, for their recovery! And Aidan, for his release!

Parker-Neutral:
Hear, hear!

Geoffrey-Neutral:
*chug*

Philippe-Neutral:
Guh, how unsophisticated.

Parker-Neutral:
Come on, Phillippe, Rory and Erik were just discharged from the clinic, and Aidan was released. It’s a celebration. Live a little.

Philippe-Neutral:
…*sip*

Rory-Neutral:
Thanks, everyone.

Aidan-Neutral:
It’s great that you and Rory finally got discharged, bro.

Erik-Neutral:
Thanks, and congrats on your release, Aidan.

Aidan-Neutral:
Thank you.

Aren-Neutral:
Heheh.

Blaire-Neutral:
Don’t you think I’d forget you, Aren! The woman of the hour! If it weren’t for you, we would’ve lost Rory.

Aren-Neutral:
It was nothing. You guys would’ve done the same thing.

Parker-Neutral:
Give yourself some credit, Aren. You were the one who did it.

Geoffrey-Neutral:
Yeah, so you better take the praise or else!

Aren-Neutral:
All right, all right. Thanks.

Blaire-Neutral:
Now that that’s out of the way. Time for another round, on Geoffrey!

Philippe-Neutral:
Now, I can agree to that.

Parker-Neutral:
Yes, please!

Erik-Neutral:
Absolutely.

Aidan-Neutral:
Yes!

Geoffrey-Angry:
Wha!? No way! My tab is big enough as it is!

Blaire-Neutral:
So, what’s a little more?

Rory-Neutral:
It’s great to see everyone is the same as ever.

Aren-Neutral:
Yeah, a bunch of knuckleheads.

Rory-Neutral:
Haha, yeah. Hey, Aren, thanks for saving me.

Aren-Neutral:
It’s no problem. I’d do anything for our group.

Rory-Neutral:
Modest as always, Aren. Now, let’s go get that next round.

Aren-Neutral:
On Geoffrey!
