Aren-Sad:
What turned you into this?

Feral Shifter-Portraitless:
*whine*

Aren-Sad:
I’m sorry, I don’t know how to help you...

Feral Shifter-Portraitless:
*whine*
*CRACK* \n*SNAP* \n*POP*
Ughhhh…

Aren-Sad<hcg>:
Oh Rory.

Rory-Sad:
I’m- I’m so sorry, Aren. I didn’t mean-

Aren-Neutral:
I know.

Rory-Scared:
It hurts. So much. I feel like I’m being torn apart. Like my wolf is ripping away from me. \nPlease make it stop. Please. I can’t. The pain. It’s too much.

Aren-Scared:
I- I don’t know how.

Rory-Scared:
Please. \nHelp me.

Aren-Scared:
Rory, just stay put. I’ll go get help.

Rory-Angry:
*growl*

Rory-Scared<s>:
No! \nI can’t control it! Make it stop!

Aren-Scared:
Rory!

Rory-Scared:
It’s too much, Aren! \nIt’s tearing me apart! I can’t-

Rory-Portraitless:
*Anguished Cry*

Aren-Scared:
RORY!!!

Rory-Portraitless:
*thud*

Aren-Sad:
Rory?

Warrick-Neutral:
She’s still breathing, but it’s faint. \nI don’t think she has long.

Isabella-Sad:
Is there anything we can do?

Warrick-Sad:
Nothing we’re capable of, I’m afraid. Given the intricacy of the magic circle, we’d need at least a master, maybe even a grandmaster, to properly dismantle the spell.

Aren-Thinking:
The circle… 

Aren-Surprised<j>:
That’s it!

Isabella-Surprised:
What about the circle? \nWhat did you figure out, Aren?

Aren-Neutral:
It’s a longshot, but I might have a way to save Rory.

Isabella-Neutral:
Let’s hear it then.

Aren-Neutral:
We break the magic circle.

Warrick-Thinking:
That’s… \nI don’t- \nI don’t think that’s a good idea-

Isabella-Angry<s>:
It’s an incredibly stupid idea, is what it is! \nBy the moon- \nWhat makes you think that will even work?!

Aren-Angry:
Because there’s nothing else we CAN do!!!

Isabella-Sad:
…

Warrick-Sad:
…

Aren-Sad:
Because it’s either that or we stand here and watch her die.

Aren-Angry:
And I refuse to do that.

Isabella-Sad:
…

Warrick-Neutral:
… \nOkay.

Isabella-Angry:
Okay? \nOkay?! \nThis is a powerful magic circle we’re talking about! 

Isabella-Sad:
It could kill you, Aren.

Aren-Neutral:
Maybe. \nBut I’d rather that than let this happen to my friends and potentially my whole pack.
This is bigger than just Aiden and Rory.

Aren-Angry:
And I’m going to make sure it ends here. \nNow.
