Oh! I just got an alert on my computer!

Aren-default:
Looks like a message from the Pack Leader.

Aren-default:
"To All Pack Members,
An emergency Town Pack Meeting has been called.
The meeting will start at 10am in the town hall.
Attendance is mandatory for all adult pack members.

Warrick Henderson
Pack Leader"

Aren-thinking:
That sounds serious, I wonder what must have happened.

Aren-thinking:
It's almost 9am, I should head out soon if I want to be at the meeting on time.
