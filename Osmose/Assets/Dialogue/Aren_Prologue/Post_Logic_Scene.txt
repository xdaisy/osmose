Aren-Neutral:
(Well, here I am.) \n(About to do something both incredibly brave and incredibly stupid.)
(Not very logical of you, Aren.)

Warrick-Neutral:
You alright, pup?

Aren-Scared:
Ahh!

Aren-Neutral:
Oh. \nSorry. \nI got a little lost in my thoughts there. 

Warrick-Sad:
Can’t blame you, pup. \nWhat you’re planning to do is incredibly dangerous.

Isabella-Sad:
You don’t have to do this, Aren. \nIt’s a risky plan at best, and a death sentence at worst.

Aren-Sad:
I know, but I want to do this.

Aren-Neutral:
I need to do this.

Rory-Portraitless:
*whine*

Aren-Neutral:
Don’t worry, Rory. I’ll save you.

Aren-Portraitless:
*kicks dirt*

Portraitless:
*woosh* *woosh*

Rory-Portraitless:
AWHOOOO!

Rory-Sad:
Ha…ha….

Warrick-Neutral:
Is she..?

Isabella-Surprised:
My gods, she did it.

Rory-Portraitless:
*collapses*

Aren-Surprised:
RORY!

Warrick-Neutral:
Oh no!\n…Don’t worry, she’s alive. Looks like the worst is over.

Isabella-Neutral:
We’ll need to take her to the clinic to be sure.

Isabella-Neutral:
Aren, that plan of yours was idiotic, but somehow it worked. Good job, pup.

Aren-Neutral:
I’m just glad Rory will be alright. Now, let’s get her to the clinic.
